  \subsection{Introduction}


  \qquad Welcome to \textbf{Wee Dig Dug}, a simplified, text-based version of the popular arcade game \textbf{Dig Dug} by Namco!.
  The following project was written in ARM Assembly for the LPC2138 Education Board, with the ARM7TDMI architecture.

  You are playing as Mr. Wee Dug, a glorious knight and miner (yes, it is an unconventional combination).
  You have been recruited by some villagers to kill a few beasts and you get paid depending on what kind of beast you kill.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Kill a \textbf{FYGAR}, a species of vicious dragons, known to take a 100 knights to defeat a single one, and you get \underline{100 points}.
    \item Kill a \textbf{POOKA}, often mistaken for a cute, cuddly creature until it tries to eat you up, and you get \underline{50 points}.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Setup}

  Before playing the game, please make sure of the following:

  \begin{enumerate} 
    \item You are connected to the correct COM port on PuTTy, and at a baud rate of \textbf{\underline{115200 baud}}.
    \item Resize the console window to a minimum of $ 30 \text{ rows} \times 130 \text{ columns} $.
    \item Be prepared to enjoy the game.
  \end{enumerate}

  To start playing, just flash the code onto the LPC2138 board.
