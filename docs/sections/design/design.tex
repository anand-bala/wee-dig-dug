\section{Design}

The game is designed based on the \textbf{Model-View-Controller (MVC)} architecture.
This architecture is a common way of designing applications with a User Interface.
In it, each of the following components is responsible for a particular task, and only that component is allowed to perform that task.

    \multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Model}}  & This is the part of the framework responsible for maintainin the internal representation of the application.                      \\
                            & The \textbf{Model} in this game holds the location where sand is present, state of each sprite and state variables of the game. \\
    \hline

    \multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{View}}   & The \textbf{View} is responsible for rendering the \textbf{Model} onto the GUI. \\
                            & It contains routines that display the board, the sprites and the sand on a console screen.                                        \\
    \hline

    \multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Controller}} & The \textbf{Controller} is responsible for handling user input and triggering changes in the \textbf{Model}.\\
                            & It contains the entry point for the game and interrupt handlers. \\
