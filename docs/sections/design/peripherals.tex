The subroutine update_peripherals, updates the 7 segment display, the rgb Leds, and Leds and
this routine is called model.s which maintains the internal representation of the board and
triggers View updates, which then is called by controller.s. 7-segment display is updated when
the user bumps up a level. LEDs represent the number of lives left. RGB LEDs represent the
state of the game. Before game is played, RGB LED is white. When game is active the RGB
LED is green. When paused, RGB LED is blue, when the game ends, RGB LED is purple and
when shots fired, the RGB LED blinks red. Since the update_peripherals is called using a timer
handler, the blinking functionally of RGB LED is achieved by setting a FLAG and every time a
pump sprite moves, the flag is set to either 0 or a 1. If FLAG is 0, then the RDG LED flashes red.
If Flag is 1 then RGB LED Flashes green.
