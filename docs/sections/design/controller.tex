\subsection{Controller}

  \quad\textbf{FILES}: \texttt{controller.s}

  The \textbf{Controller} mainly contains interrupt handlers, and it is also the entry point for the game.
  In is, we do the following:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize timer and timer match registers for periodic interrupts.
    \item Listen for UART0 interrupt, read the keystrokes and perform the corresponding action.
    \item Listen for External Interrupt Button press and PAUSE the game.
  \end{itemize}

  The \textbf{Controller} is a relatively small component, responsible mainly for updating the \textbf{Model} via subroutines exposed by the \textbf{Model}.
