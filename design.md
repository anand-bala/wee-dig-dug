# Proposed Design

## model.s

This file will hold the model of the game.

### Inputs needed during initialization

1. Size of board (Default: 15x19)
2. Size of sprite (Default: 1x1)

### It will keep track of the following:

1. Position and state of sprites on board
2. Position of all the sand
3. Score/Level

### Routines

* Initialize model
* Move sprite
* Check for collisions

## text-gui.s
